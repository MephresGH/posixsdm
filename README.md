## ADDITIONAL NOTES
POSIXSDM is installed into the user's .config directory by default, or inserted into /usr/bin, then called at the end of the user's .profile configuration.
Due to this approach, certain applications that might behave as login shells or similar will cause issues.
Tmux users will have to add conditional checks in their .profile or make sure their program of choice will call an interactive shell instead.
This is done to prevent programs like Tmux from running the .profile configuration file from the shell of your choice and reduce headaches.
I am not sure what other programs might cause complications of this kind, so I don't think I can implement checks for any of them.
Users of POSIXSDM will have to add such conditional checks or changes in their configuration files on their own to minimize friction.
If there are other methods to initialize shell scripts after TTY logins, or if there are better approaches in general here, please let me know.
